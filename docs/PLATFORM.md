## Overview

Two repositories form one platform: **stocks_lakehouse** collects and analyses India and US market data, and
**paper-trader** uses that analysis to run a mock intraday trader with dummy money (Rs 1,00,000), with every
trade approved by you on Telegram.

- **stocks_lakehouse** fetches NSE, US (Massive) and global (FRED) data into S3 and Databricks, builds
  bronze → silver → gold tables, sends the 08:45 pre-market brief and serves the dashboard.
- **paper-trader** reads the same gold tables before the open to set the day's risk and focus list, runs two
  Claude Code sessions in GitHub Actions, and sends its journal back to the lakehouse at 15:45 for analysis and
  as a backup record.
- Both run on one AWS account (free plan, Sydney), one Databricks Free Edition workspace, one Telegram bot,
  and the same GitHub CI/CD pattern.

## System diagram

**At a glance** (blue = stocks_lakehouse, orange = paper-trader):

No servers anywhere: scheduled Lambdas in AWS, a GitHub Actions job for the trading session, and a Databricks
pipeline. The systems meet twice a day: the session reads the gold tables before the open, and the guardian
exports the journal to the landing volume at 15:45.

**In detail** (purple = paper-trader; source `docs/diagrams/05_platform.mmd`, identical in both repos):

Secrets (SSM) and deployments (CI/CD) are left out of both pictures; they're covered below.

## A day in the life

On a trading day the lakehouse feeds the trader in the morning and the trader feeds the lakehouse in the
afternoon. All times IST; every step is scheduled, nothing needs you except the YES/NO taps.

| Time (IST) | Days | System | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| 04:30 | Tue–Sat | Lakehouse | Massive: previous US session, all US stocks |
| 06:00 | Tue–Sat | Lakehouse | FRED: indices, FX, VIX, oil, rates (21-day window) |
| 08:45 | Mon–Fri | Lakehouse | Pre-market brief to Telegram |
| 09:08 | Mon–Fri | Trader | Kicker Lambda starts the morning session; plan + focus list to Telegram |
| 09:16 | Mon–Fri | Trader | GitHub cron backup start (skips if already running) |
| 09:20–12:25 | Mon–Fri | Trader | Every 5 min: check positions, scan focus list, propose; you tap YES/NO |
| 12:27 | Mon–Fri | Trader | Afternoon session; new entries stop at 14:30 |
| 15:10 | Mon–Fri | Trader | Square-off, then day report to Telegram |
| 15:12 / 15:40 | Mon–Fri | Trader | Guardian backstops: square-off and report if the session didn't |
| 15:45 | Mon–Fri | Trader → Lakehouse | Journal export to `landing/trades/`; pipeline builds the trading tables |
| 19:30 | Mon–Fri | Lakehouse | NSE bhavcopy for the day; pipeline refresh |
| every 2 min | all week | Trader | Responder answers Telegram commands when no session is live |

## Components

Every running part is either a scheduled Lambda in AWS Sydney, a Databricks object, or a GitHub Actions job;
there are no servers.

| Component | Repo | Runs on | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fetcher Lambdas (NSE, Massive, FRED) | lakehouse | AWS Lambda | Download a day of data, archive it in S3, push the same file to the Databricks volume |
| S3 landing bucket | lakehouse | AWS S3 | Permanent, untouched raw archive (private, encrypted, versioned) |
| Sync Lambda | lakehouse | AWS Lambda | Copies anything missing from S3 to the volume (backfills, repairs) |
| Landing volume | lakehouse | Databricks | `/Volumes/stocks/bronze/landing/<source>/date=…/`, what the pipeline reads |
| `stocks-medallion` pipeline | lakehouse | Databricks | Bronze streaming tables, silver and gold materialized views |
| `stocks-refresh` job | lakehouse | Databricks | Runs the pipeline when files land (waits 5 min, at most every 15 min) |
| Dashboard | lakehouse | Databricks | Market pages + **Paper trading** page on the gold tables |
| Pre-market Lambda | lakehouse | AWS Lambda | 08:45 brief: queries gold, sends Telegram |
| Trading session | paper-trader | GitHub Actions | Claude Code + paper-trader MCP tools; morning and afternoon runs |
| Trader engine and MCP tools | paper-trader | inside the session | Ledger, risk gate, Telegram approvals, simulated fills, exits, report |
| Trader state bucket | paper-trader | AWS S3 | Ledger, journal, plans, reports, exports |
| Kicker Lambda | paper-trader | AWS Lambda | Starts each session on time via the GitHub API |
| Guardian Lambda | paper-trader | AWS Lambda | No Claude: 15:12 square-off, 15:40 report, 15:45 export to the lakehouse |
| Responder Lambda | paper-trader | AWS Lambda | Answers `/help`, `/ledger`, `/plan`, `/pause`, `/resume` outside sessions within ~2 min |

## Data flows and contracts

The two systems touch in exactly two places, and each has a fixed contract: the trader reads named gold tables
in the morning, and writes one JSON-lines file per day in the afternoon.

| Flow | From → to | Contract | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Market data in | NSE, Massive, FRED → S3 + volume | One file per source per day under `<source>/date=YYYY-MM-DD/` | 04:30, 06:00, 19:30 |
| Pre-market context | gold tables → trader (`premarket_context`) | Read-only SQL on `nifty_after_us_moves_summary`, `global_snapshot`, `unusual_volume`, `silver.daily_bars` | ~09:10 |
| Approvals | Trader ↔ Telegram | Proposal with YES/NO buttons; no reply in 3 min = skipped; `EXIT SYMBOL` closes | 09:20–14:30 |
| Commands | You → Telegram → session or responder | `/help` (also "what can you do?"), `/ledger`, `/plan`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/exit`. Telegram allows one reader: the session answers while live, the responder otherwise | any time |
| Ledger | Trader ↔ S3 `state/ledger.json` | Read, change, write back on every tool call; versioned 30 days | all session |
| Journal export | Trader → `landing/trades/date=YYYY-MM-DD/events.jsonl` | One line per event with unique `event_id` + `proposal_id`; last line `ledger_snapshot` | 15:45 |
| Trading analysis | `trades_raw` → `trade_events` → `gold.trad*` | Newest copy per `event_id`; net P&L = exit `pnl_rs` − entry `fees_rs` | after 15:45 |

**Reconciliation.** `gold.trading_daily` rebuilds each day's realized P&L from the events and compares it with
the ledger's own `realized_today` from the snapshot line: `ok` within Rs 1, `MISMATCH` otherwise. Two
independent records that must agree is the platform's main integrity check on the dummy money.

**Money on Telegram.** Every proposal shows the margin it needs against what's free; every fill and exit ends
with `Ledger: balance … | in use … | free … | today …`. In use = position value ÷ 5 (simulated intraday
margin), free = balance − in use.

**Gold tables for trading:** `trades` (each trade, R multiple), `trading_daily`, `trading_by_setup`,
`trading_by_hour`, `trading_decisions` (what skipped proposals would have made).

## Platform constraints and design decisions

The design follows from three free tiers; each row is a limit we hit or planned around, and what the platform
does about it.

| Limit | Where | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Only S3, Lambda, EventBridge Scheduler, SSM, IAM roles, CloudWatch Logs | AWS free plan | No servers: every job is a scheduled Lambda; the first EC2 design was denied and rebuilt |
| Only Sydney, us-east-1, us-west-2 | AWS free plan | Everything in ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) |
| No IAM identity providers (no GitHub OIDC) | AWS free plan | CI uses IAM users with access keys stored in GitHub environments |
| Lambda runs at most 15 min | AWS Lambda | The 3-hour Claude Code sessions run in GitHub Actions instead |
| A job lasts at most 6 h; cron can start late or not at all | GitHub Actions | Morning + afternoon sessions; kicker Lambda starts them on time, cron as backup |
| Branch rules only on public repos (free plan) | GitHub | Both repos public; no secrets in code |
| Serverless compute quota | Databricks Free Edition | Files land a few times a day; the trader exports once at 15:45, not per trade |
| Usage limits shared with your chats | Claude Pro/Max | One `run_cycle` + one wait per 5 min; guardian squares off if a session stops |
| Prices unofficial, may lag minutes | Yahoo Finance | Accepted for mock trading; tested from GitHub runners |

## Security, identities and secrets

Each identity can do one job; no secret lives in code, and the only person with full access is you through
`aws login`.

| Identity | Used by | Can |
|---|---|---|
| You (`AccountFullAccessRole` via `aws login`) | Local Terraform, setup | Everything in the project |
| `stocks-gha-plan` | Both repos: plan on PR | Read-only (no state lock) |
| `stocks-gha-apply` | Both repos: apply on merge | Manage project services; IAM only for `stocks-*` roles and `stocks-gha-*` users |
| `stocks-gha-trader` | Trading session | Read/write the trader state bucket (no delete); read Telegram + Databricks parameters |
| Lakehouse Lambda roles | Fetchers, sync, pre-market | Their own bucket, parameters and the pusher token |
| `stocks-trader-guardian-role` | Guardian and responder Lambdas | Trader state bucket; Telegram + Databricks push parameters |
| `stocks-trader-kicker-role` | Kicker Lambda | Read the GitHub dispatch token only |
| Claude in a session | Trading session | Only the paper-trader MCP tools; no shell, files or web |

| Secret | Lives in | Expires | Rotate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Telegram bot token, chat ID | SSM `/stocks/telegram-*` | Never | BotFather if leaked |
| Databricks pusher token | SSM `/stocks/databricks-pusher-token` | 180 days | Lakehouse runbook |
| Massive API key | SSM `/stocks/*` | Never | Massive dashboard if leaked |
| GitHub dispatch token | SSM `/stocks-trader/github-dispatch-token` | 1 year | New fine-grained token with **Actions: Read and write** on paper-trader, then `put-parameter` |
| Claude token | GitHub env `trading` | 1 year | `claude setup-token` |
| CI and session AWS keys | GitHub secrets / environments | Never | Yearly, two keys per user allowed |

Trades still need your YES: the engine refuses to execute anything not approved, whatever Claude asks.

## CI/CD and branch rules

Both repos ship the same way: work on `dev`, open a pull request to `main`, read the Terraform plan in the PR
comment, merge to apply.

1. Push to `dev` → CI: Python tests, `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate` per stack.
2. Pull request `dev` → `main` → `terraform plan` with the read-only identity, posted as a PR comment.
3. Merge → `terraform apply` in the `production` environment; the next scheduled run uses the new code.

| | stocks_lakehouse | paper-trader |
|---|---|---|
| Stacks | `aws`, `databricks` (+ `bootstrap` once) | `aws` |
| State | S3 bucket `stocks-lakehouse-tfstate-<account>` | Same bucket, key `paper-trader/aws/` |
| Required checks on `main` | `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate (aws)`, `terraform validate (databricks)` | `Python tests and MCP server`, `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate (aws)` |
| Ruleset `protect-main` | PR required, no force push, no deletion | same |
| Extra workflow | — | `trading-session.yml` (environment `trading`) |

Shared conventions: LF line endings (`.gitattributes`), committed `project.auto.tfvars` for non-secret
settings, committed `.terraform.lock.hcl`, docs in `docs/` (ARCHITECTURE, SETUP, OPERATIONS, TROUBLESHOOTING,
PLATFORM), Mermaid diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` with one shared theme.

## Operations, costs and where to find things

The platform is meant to run at no extra cost beyond your Claude plan; the first cost review is on
Sunday 15 Nov 2026, after a full trading week.

| Cost item | Expected | Watch |
|---|---|---|
| AWS (Lambda, S3, Scheduler, SSM) | Near zero, inside free-plan credits | AWS Settings → project credits |
| Databricks | Free Edition quota | Pipeline runs per day |
| GitHub Actions | Free (public repos) | Session run time, ~6 h per trading day |
| Claude | Your Pro/Max plan | Sessions ending early on usage limits |
| Data (Massive, FRED, NSE, Yahoo) | Free tiers | Fetch failures in Lambda logs |
